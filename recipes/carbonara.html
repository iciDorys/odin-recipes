     <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that's so creamy, you'd swear there's a good amount of cream in it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
    <ul>
        <li>175g guanciale (pancetta or block bacon)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 eggs yolks</li>
        <li>100g parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking or kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Guanciale - Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li>Carbonara sauce - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li>Reserve pasta water - Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook guanciale - While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat.<br> 
            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed - as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat.<br> 
            If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li>Pasta in pan - Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Mix pasta in sauce - Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water.<br> 
            Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Serve - Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
